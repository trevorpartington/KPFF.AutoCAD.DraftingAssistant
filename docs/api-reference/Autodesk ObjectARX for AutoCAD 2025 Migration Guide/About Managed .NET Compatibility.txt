About Managed .NET Compatibility
 
 
 
Managed .NET applications are often associated with corporate and third-party applications that extend the behavior and capabilities of the AutoCAD-based product. 

When migrating to the latest release, not all .NET applications might work. Compatibility for .NET applications is subject to change between releases to take advantage of the latest .NET Framework and additions to the AutoCAD Managed .NET API. 

The following table lists the Managed .NET SDK versions that are supported by AutoCAD-based product release and the .NET Framework that is supported.

Changes to the Managed .NET SDK can be found in the Whatâ€™s New and Migration Guide section of the Managed .NET Reference Guide (<drive>:\<objectarx install folder>\docs\arxmgd.chm). 

NOTE:Starting with AutoCAD 2014-based products, custom applications must work under secure mode; when the SECURELOAD system variable is set to 1 or 2. When operating under secure mode, the AutoCAD-based product is restricted to loading and executing files that contain code from trusted locations; trusted locations are specified by the TRUSTEDPATHS system variable. For more information, see About Security and Protecting Against Viruses.
