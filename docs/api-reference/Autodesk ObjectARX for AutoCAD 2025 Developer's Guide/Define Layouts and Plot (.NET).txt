After you have created a drawing with AutoCAD, you usually plot or publish it. A plotted drawing can contain a single view of your drawing or a more complex arrangement of views. You create windows called floating viewports in Paper space in which are used to display various views of the drawing. Depending on your needs, you can plot one or more viewports, or set options that determine what is plotted and how the image fits in the final output format.
