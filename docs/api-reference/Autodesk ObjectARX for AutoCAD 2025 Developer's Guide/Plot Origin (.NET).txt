Plot Origin (.NET)
 
 
 
The plot origin is the lower-left corner of the specified plotted area and can be queried with the PlotOrigin property. Typically, the plot origin is set to (0, 0). However, a plot can be centered on the sheet of paper. The PlotCentered property returns if the plot is currently centered; if TRUE the plot is centered. Centering the plot alters the plot origin.
