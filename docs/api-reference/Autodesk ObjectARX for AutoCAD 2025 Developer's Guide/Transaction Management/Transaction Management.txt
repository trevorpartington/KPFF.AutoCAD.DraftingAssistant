Transaction Management
 
 
 
This section describes the transaction model, which can be used to operate on AcDb objects. In this model, multiple operations on multiple objects are grouped together into one atomic operation called a transaction. 

Transactions can be nested and can be ended or aborted at the discretion of the client. This model can be used in conjunction with the regular per-object open and close mechanism described in Database Objects.
