Plot Styles (.NET)
 
 
 
Plot styles are used to override some object properties that control the way an object appears in the output. The plot style assigned to a layout or page setup is stored in the CurrentStyleSheet property. You use the SetCurrentStyleSheet method of the PlotSettingsValidator object to assign a plot style to a PlotSettings object. Based on how a drawing was created, it uses either color-dependent or named plot styles. You can use the PlotStyleMode property of the current database to determine which type of plot style the drawing is using. 

You can obtain a list of all available plot styles using the GetPlotStyleSheetList method of the PlotSettingsValidator object. The listed plot styles are the same ones that are displayed in the Plot or Page Setup dialog boxes. 

List the available plot style
This example lists the plot styles that are available. 

VB.NET
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices

' Lists the available plot styles
<CommandMethod("PlotStyleList")> _
Public Shared Sub PlotStyleList()
    ' Get the current document and database, and start a transaction
    Dim acDoc As Document = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument

    acDoc.Editor.WriteMessage(vbLf & "Plot styles: ")

    For Each plotStyle As String In PlotSettingsValidator.Current.GetPlotStyleSheetList()
        ' Output the names of the available plot styles
        acDoc.Editor.WriteMessage(vbLf & "  " & plotStyle)
    Next
End SubC#
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices;

// Lists the available plot styles
[CommandMethod("PlotStyleList")]
public static void PlotStyleList()
{
    // Get the current document and database, and start a transaction
    Document acDoc = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument;

    acDoc.Editor.WriteMessage("\nPlot styles: ");

    foreach (string plotStyle in PlotSettingsValidator.Current.GetPlotStyleSheetList())
    {
        // Output the names of the available plot styles
        acDoc.Editor.WriteMessage("\n  " + plotStyle);
    }
