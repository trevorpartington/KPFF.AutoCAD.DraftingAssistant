Layout settings control the final output of a drawing when plotted or published. These settings affect the paper size, plot scale, plot area, plot origin, and the plot device name. Understanding how to use layout settings ensures that the layout is plotted as expected. Most settings related to outputting a layout are read-only. Changing the plot settings for a layout requires the use of the PlotSettings and PlotSettingsValidator objects.
