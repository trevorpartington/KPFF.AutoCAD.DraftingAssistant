Dynamic Block Properties
 
 
 
Dynamic block applications may query and set dynamic block properties by using the AcDbDynBlockReference and AcDbDynBlockReferenceProperty classes. An AcDbDynBlockReference object is initialized by constructing it with the object ID of a dynamic block reference. This establishes the object as a wrapper for the given reference. 

Once the AcDbDynBlockReference object is properly initialized, the application can call the AcDbDynBlockReference::getBlockProperties() function to get an array of the reference's properties. Each AcDbDynBlockReferenceProperty object in the returned array represents a single property on the dynamic block reference. These objects can be used to perform a variety of operations on the properties they represent. See the ObjectARX Reference for more information on the AcDbDynBlockReference and AcDbDynBlockReferenceProperty classes.
