AutoCAD Â® block entities support enhancements that let users specialize instances of block definitions. Blocks that support such specialization are known as dynamic blocks. With dynamic block API classes, you can query and set properties of dynamic block references. With dynamic block extension classes, you can add custom grip points and insertion points to blocks. 

The dynamic block API also exposes a set of graph evaluation classes. These classes define a general mechanism that applications can use to create their own systems of intelligent dependencies.
