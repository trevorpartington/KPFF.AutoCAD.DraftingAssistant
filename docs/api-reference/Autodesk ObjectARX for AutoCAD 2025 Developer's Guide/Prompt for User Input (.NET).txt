Prompt for User Input (.NET)
 
 
 
The Editor object, which is a child of the Document object, defines the user input methods. The user input methods display a prompt on the AutoCAD command line or in a dynamic input tooltip, and request input of various types. This type of user input is most useful for interactive input of screen coordinates, entity selection, and short-string or numeric values. If your application requires the input of numerous options or values, a Windows form may be more appropriate than individual prompts. 

Each user input method displays an optional prompt on the command line and returns a value specific to the type of input requested. For example, GetString returns a PromptResult which allows you to determine the status of the GetString method and retrieve the string the user entered. Each one of the user input methods has a specific return value. 

The input methods accept a string for the prompt message to be displayed or a specific object type which controls the input from the user. These object types let you control things such as NULL input (pressing Enter), base point, input of zero or negative numbers, and input of arbitrary text values. 

To force the prompt to be displayed on a line by itself, use the carriage return/linefeed constant (vbCrLf) or linefeed constant (vbLf) at the beginning of your prompt strings when using VB.NET, or "\n" with strings in C#.
