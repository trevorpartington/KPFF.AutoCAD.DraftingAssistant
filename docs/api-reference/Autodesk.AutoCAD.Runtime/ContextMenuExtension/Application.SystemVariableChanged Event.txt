Application.SystemVariableChanged Event    Description
 

Wraps the AcEditorReactor.sysVarChanged() ObjectARX function. This callback indicates that an attempt was made to change the varName system variable. It does not indicate that the actual value was changed. 

 

This callback always occurs when a system variable is changed directly through the SETVAR command or by entering the variable name at the command line. For other built-in AutoCAD commands that provoke system variable changes, this notification is not guaranteed.
