Property  Description  
 AcadWindowId  
Returns the Viewport index number of the viewport being drawn to. This is the same index that the AutoCAD CVPORT... more  
 CameraLocation  
Returns camera location to the viewport camera's world coordinate location. This is where the viewport's "eye" would be in world... more  
 CameraTarget  
Returns the camera target location point to the viewport camera's world coordinate target. This is a point where the viewport's... more  
 CameraUpVector  
Returns the camera "up" direction vector to the viewport camera's world coordinate "up" vector. This is the world space vector... more  
 DeviceContextViewportCorners  
It positions the geometry (such as icons) that remain in a fixed position or fixed size in the viewport's display.... more  
 EyeToModelTransform  
Returns the transformation matrix to the current eye coordinate to Model Coordinate transformation matrix.  
 EyeToWorldTransform  
Returns the transformation matrix to the current eye coordinate to Model Coordinate transformation matrix.  
 FrontAndBackClipping  
Fills in the parameters with information about the existence and location of front and back display clipping planes. Clipping planes... more  
 IsPerspective  
Returns true if perspective mode is in effect. Otherwise, returns false.  
 LinetypeGenerationCriteria  
During linetype elaboration of ever smaller objects, a point is reached where the dashes are so small as to be... more  
 LinetypeScaleMultiplier  
This is a value supplied by the viewport itself. It is an additional multiplier that is used affecting all linetypes... more  
 ModelToEyeTransform  
Transforms matrix to the current Model Coordinate to eye coordinate.  
 ViewDirection  
Returns the current view direction of the viewport. This value can be calculated from the target and camera points in... more  
 ViewportId  
Returns the viewport ID. This is an AcGi-specific ID that has no relation to the AutoCAD CVPORT system variable. This... more  
 WorldToEyeTransform  
Transforms matrix to the current World Coordinate to eye coordinate transformation matrix.
