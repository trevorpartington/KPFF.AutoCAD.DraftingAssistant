Transaction.GetObject(ObjectId, Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.OpenMode, [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] bool) MethodDescription
This function calls the Open() function of the top transaction passing on all the arguments it has received. Objects can only be obtained within the top transaction, so this function saves the trouble of having to either keep a pointer to the top transaction or use the TransactionManager.TopTransaction property to obtain it. 

If the openErased Boolean is true, then even an erased object can be obtained. If openErased is false, then trying to obtain an erased entity results in an error return value. 

 

For more information, see the section on transactions in the ObjectARX Developer's Guide.
