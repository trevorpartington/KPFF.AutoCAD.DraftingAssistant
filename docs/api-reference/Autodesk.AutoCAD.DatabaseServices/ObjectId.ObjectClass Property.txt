ObjectId.ObjectClass PropertyDescription
Accesses the RXClass of the object that is associated with the object id, thus guaranteeing that the result can be safely de-referenced and correctly compared against any class derived from DBObject. This is done because the entire purpose of this property is to streamline code being written; having to always compare the result against NULL would partially defeat the purpose of the function.

Visual Basic
Public Property ObjectClass() As RXClass
C#
public RXClass ObjectClass;
Conditions
Read-only

Notes
Use this property to obtain the associated object class without having to open and close the object itself. 

If the object has not been read in from disk, the disk image will be scanned, but the object will remain on disk after the usage.
