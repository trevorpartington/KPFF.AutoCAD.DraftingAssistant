Viewport.ViewportId Property    Description
 

Returns the viewport ID. This is an AcGi-specific ID that has no relation to the AutoCAD CVPORT system variable. This ID is used by the ViewportDraw.isValidId() function to determine if a viewport is still valid. 

 

The ID returned by this function is unique for every viewport in AutoCAD (including Paper Space Viewports and tiled view windows when TILEMODE == 1) much the way a handle is for an entity.
