ViewTableRecord.IsPaperspaceView PropertyDescription
 

Returns true if this ViewTableRecord is a Paper Space view. Otherwise it returns false. 

 

Within AutoCAD, if a Paper Space view is restored while in Model Space, AutoCAD automatically switches to Paper Space. If a Model Space view is restored while in PaperSpace, AutoCAD prompts the end user to determine which Model Space viewport to restore it to. 

 

The isPaperSpaceView flag is represented as bit 1 of DXF group code 70 (if bit 1 is set, then the view is a Paper Space view).
