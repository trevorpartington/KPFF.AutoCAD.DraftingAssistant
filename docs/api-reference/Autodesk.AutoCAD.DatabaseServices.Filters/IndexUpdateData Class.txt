Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Filters Namespace > IndexUpdateData Class
IndexUpdateData ClassDescription
 

This .NET class wraps the AcDbIndexUpdateData ObjectARX class. 

This class is used to serve as a mapping between an ObjectId and any index specific data or flags. For example, during spatial index update, one could associate an entity extents with the ObjectId within this instance. 

The primary purpose of the class's get and set methods is to give applications a non-intrusive yet efficient method (O(1)) of associating flags and data with an ObjectId during an index update. 

An IndexUpdateData instance is never directly instantiated. It is always supplied as an argument.
