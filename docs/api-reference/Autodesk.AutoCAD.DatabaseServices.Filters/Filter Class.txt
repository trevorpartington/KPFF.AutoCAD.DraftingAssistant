Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Filters Namespace > Filter Class
Filter ClassDescription
 

This .NET class wraps the AcDbFilter ObjectARX class. 

 

This class defines a "query." It provides the "key" to the CompositeFilteredBlockIterator, for which the corresponding index is obtained through the IndexClass property. 

The AcDbSpatialFilter.IndexClass property will return SpatialIndex.Desc. 

 

Applications that need to provide their own indexing scheme need to provide versions of these three classes: 

Index 
Filter 
FilteredBlockIterator
