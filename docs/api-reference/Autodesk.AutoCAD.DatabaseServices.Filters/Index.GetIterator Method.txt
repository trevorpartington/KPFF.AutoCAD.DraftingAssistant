Index.GetIterator MethodDescription
This function will create a new FilteredBlockIterator object. The index and filter classes should be compatible. The returned index iterator will essentially be the method by which the results of the query posted to the index object is traversed. It is up to the concrete class implementation to verify whether or not the index is up-to-date and valid. 

Returns a FilteredBlockIterator abstract base class or NULL if unsuccessful. It is up to the concrete class to perform a timestamp validity check if desired.
