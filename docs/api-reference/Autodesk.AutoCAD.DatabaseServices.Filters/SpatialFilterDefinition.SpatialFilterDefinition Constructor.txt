SpatialFilterDefinition.SpatialFilterDefinition ConstructorDescription
 

This is the constructor for the SpatialFilterDefinition object.

Visual Basic
Public Sub New(
    pts As Point2dCollection, 
    normal As Vector3d, 
    elevation As double, 
    frontClip As double, 
    backClip As double, 
    enabled As [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] bool
)
C#
public SpatialFilterDefinition(
    Point2dCollection pts, 
    Vector3d normal, 
    double elevation, 
    double frontClip, 
    double backClip, 
    [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] bool enabled
);
Parameters
Parameters  Description  
Point2dCollection pts  Input boundary definition. If the number of points is 2, they are diagonal points of a rectangle. Otherwise, they are vertices of a polygon. The polygon should be non self intersecting.  
Vector3d normal  Input positive extrusion direction vector  
double elevation  Input elevation; along with the normal, this will define an ECS in which the polygon points are defined  
double frontClip  Input front clip distance in the positive extrusion direction  
double backClip  Input back clip distance in the negative extrusion direction  
[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] bool enabled  Input Boolean to make the clip volume effective, or alternatively, be all of 3D space
